**Overview** : This is a package that I created to help with some analysis that you might want to do with a Gaussian and a Binomial
distribution

This is what the package can handle:
	*compute the mean
    *compute standart deviation
    *compute the probability density
    *sum dristributions
    *ploting the df and some other basic visualizations


**Files in the repo** :
	*Binomialdistribution.py
    *Gaussiandistribution.py
    *Generaldistribution.py
    *__int__.py
    *setup.cfg 
    *README.md
    *license.md
